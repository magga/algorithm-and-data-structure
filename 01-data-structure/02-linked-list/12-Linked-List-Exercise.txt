For the exercise, create a new method to your Linked List class called "indexOf()"

This method will take in a value and it will return ALL the indexes of that value in an array

For example, there's a Linked List with value :

4, 3, 6, 4

We want to find all the indexes of value "4". We called indexOf(4) and it'll return

[0, 3]

If we call indexOf(5), it'll return

[]
